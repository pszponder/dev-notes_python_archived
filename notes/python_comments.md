# Writing Comments in Python

[Real Python - Writing Comments in Python (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/)

## Single-line Comments

Use the `#` to comment out a line

```python
# this is a python comment, it starts with "#"
# you can have multiple lines of comments

a = 1 # comment in-line with code
```

## Function Docstring

Use three sets of double quotes to create a multi-line comment, more often used when documenting functions:

```python
"""
This is
a
multi-line
comment
in Python
it is also referred to as a function docstring
"""

# Using docstring in a funcction
def foo():
    """
    This is a function docstring
    You can also use:
    ''' Function Docstring '''
    """
```
